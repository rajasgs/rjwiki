# TactSay Tech: PIL


1. Python Imaging Library(PIL) is a free and open-source additional library for the Python programming language.

2. PIL is one of the important modules for image processing in Python.

3. It adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.

4. PIL offers several standard procedures for image manipulation.

5. Some of the file formats supported are PPM, PNG, JPEG, GIF, TIFF, and BMP.

6. The core image library is designed for fast access to data stored in a few basic pixel formats. It should provide a solid foundation for a general image processing tool.

7. This library provides extensive file format support, an efficient internal representation, and fairly powerful image processing capabilities.

8. pip install PIL command is used for installing the PIL library.

9. Image.open() method, which takes an image filename as an argument returns the image object in PIL Library

10. PIL also works on practically all operating systems including, Windows, Linux, and MacOSX.
