# TactSay Tech: BeatifulSoup

1. Beautiful Soup is a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents (including having malformed markup, i.e. non-closed tags, so named after tag soup).

2. It creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data from HTML,[3] which is useful for web scraping.

3. >pip install beautifulsoup4 is the command used for installing the latest BeatifulSoup4 library

4. It’s versatile and saves a lot of time.

5. The Beautiful Soup library helps with isolating titles and links from webpages.

6. Beautiful Soup provides a few simple methods and Pythonic idioms for navigating, searching, and modifying a parse tree.

7. Beautiful Soup automatically converts incoming documents to Unicode and outgoing documents to UTF-8.

8. Beautiful Soup sits on top of popular Python parsers like lxml and html5lib, which allows​ us to try out different parsing strategies or trade speed for flexibility.

9. Beautiful Soup was started by Leonard Richardson, who continues to contribute to the project, and is additionally supported by Tidelift, a paid subscription to open-source maintenance

10. BeautifulSoup is easier to debug.
