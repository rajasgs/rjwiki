# Why You Can't Learn From LinkedIn Posts

1. There are no clear ladder to grow from random ML posts
2. Too crowded and too much information to take in a short time
3. Too many posts making me to scared of learning ML
4. Login needed which is restricted when I am at work/school
5. Lot of unnecessary promotions
